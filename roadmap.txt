PLAN FOR FUTURE WORK

ST1 PLAN!

1. Add forward/backwards buttons to HTML
2. Grey out forward button if on 1.png, and back if on the highest #.png
3. Let Flask send the number of images over! This way we can configure it there,
rather than have to keep changing stuff (in return jsonify...)

ST2 PLAN!

1. Gather some data (BYU @ Huskers, following #Huskers, and #MNF)
2. Add dropdown on left-most column for selecting file.
3. Add small description of the data that's loaded with each file switch into
that column.

ST3 PLAN!

1. Stuff dictionary into CSV file (in the images/userid folder)
2. Show download link when this is done.

Short-Term
----------
1. Allow users to look at previously generated images
2. Allow multiple JSON files
3. CSV downloads of data files

Long-Term
---------
1. Allow gathering of tweet data on the server (NOTE: don't deploy this to AWS!
it is time-consuming and can compromise the usability of the app! It should just
be a proof of concept!)

SUPER Long-Term
---------------
1. Dump data into SQL server and manipulate it that way (this necessitates
rewriting some of the processing code, since it is designed to operate on JSON
files, and while most isn't specifically dependent on JSON files (using jsonify
could work), there are some wrinkles involved)
