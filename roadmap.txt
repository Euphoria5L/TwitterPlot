PLAN FOR FUTURE WORK

Short-Term
----------
1. Allow users to look at previously generated images
2. Allow multiple JSON files
3. CSV downloads of data files

Long-Term
---------
1. Allow gathering of tweet data on the server (NOTE: don't deploy this to AWS!
it is time-consuming and can compromise the usability of the app! It should just
be a proof of concept!)
2. Allow multiple users (note: the current setup should easily allow multiple
users, but the image delivery code would need to be rewritten from the ground
up)

SUPER Long-Term
---------------
2. Dump data into SQL server and manipulate it that way (this necessitates
rewriting some of the processing code, since it is designed to operate on JSON
files, and while most isn't specifically dependent on JSON files (using jsonify
could work), there are some wrinkles involved)
