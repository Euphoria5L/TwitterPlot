PLAN FOR FUTURE WORK

NOW
---
1. Better validation
2. Check for out-of-range times on start/end time/interval.

Short-Term
----------
1. Offer easy image saving options
2. Build JSON file upload system
3. CSV downloads of time_to_tweets

Long-Term
---------
1. Allow gathering of tweet data on the server (NOTE: don't deploy this to AWS!
it is time-consuming and can compromise the usability of the app! It should just
be a proof of concept!)
2. Allow users to combine data sets.

SUPER Long-Term
---------------
1. Allow multiple users (note: the current setup could add users easily, but
given the way the processing code works, there are possible collisions and
process problems that will likely creep in, so it might need the use of
something like Twisted--this requires research and experimentation!)
2. Dump data into SQL server and manipulate it that way (this necessitates
rewriting some of the processing code, since it is designed to operate on JSON
files, and while most isn't specifically dependent on JSON files (using jsonify
could work), there are some wrinkles involved)
