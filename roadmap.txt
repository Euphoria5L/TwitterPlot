PLAN FOR FUTURE WORK

Short-Term
----------
3. CSV downloads of data files

Long-Term
---------
1. Allow gathering of tweet data on the server (NOTE: don't deploy this to AWS!
it is time-consuming and can compromise the usability of the app! It should just
be a proof of concept!)
2. Dump data into SQL server (actually, Mongo is probably a bit easier and might not necessitate changing the code too much, 
just adding code to make handling the document collections look like handling files; cursor? This requires experimentation).
